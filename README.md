# DataVault 🔐

> **Own your data. Control who sees it. Earn from it.**

DataVault is a consent-first personal data marketplace where users upload and monetize their data, while brands pay for anonymized, aggregated insights. Raw data never leaves the vault.

---

# 🌍 The Problem

Google, Meta, and data brokers scrape your digital footprints for free and sell them for billions. **You get zero.**

---

# 💡 The Solution

DataVault flips the model:

- You upload your data into an encrypted vault
- Brands pay to ask specific questions about it
- You get paid instantly when you accept
- A **Kill Switch** auto-revokes access after 24 hours
- Brands only see anonymized, aggregated signals — never raw data

# 🚀 Local Setup

## 1. Clone the repository

```bash
git clone https://github.com/YOUR_USERNAME/datavault.git
cd datavault
```

---

## 2. Create virtual environment

### Windows
```bash
python -m venv venv
venv\Scripts\activate
```

### Linux / Mac
```bash
python3 -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate
```

---

## 3. Install dependencies

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

---

## 4. Create PostgreSQL database

Create a PostgreSQL database named:

```sql
CREATE DATABASE datavault;
```

---

## 5. Setup environment variables

Create a `.env` file in the project root:

```env
DATABASE_URL=postgresql://postgres:yourpassword@localhost:5432/datavault
SECRET_KEY=your-secret-key
ENCRYPTION_KEY=your-fernet-key
ACCESS_TOKEN_EXPIRE_MINUTES=60
```

---

## 6. Generate encryption key

```bash
python -c "from cryptography.fernet import Fernet; print(Fernet.generate_key().decode())"
```

Copy the generated key into:

```env
ENCRYPTION_KEY=
```

---

## 7. Run the backend server

```bash
uvicorn app.main:app --reload
```

Backend will run at:

```text
http://127.0.0.1:8000
```

---

## 8. Open the frontend

Open:

```text
frontend/index.html
```

using VS Code Live Server.

---

# 🐳 Docker Setup (Optional)

## Build and start containers

```bash
docker-compose up --build
```

---

## Stop containers

```bash
docker-compose down
```

# 🎯 Demo Flow

## User Flow

1. Register as a user
2. Upload shopping or fitness CSV data
3. Files get encrypted instantly
4. User stores data inside personal vault

---

## Brand Flow

1. Register as a brand
2. Create a data request
3. Select:
   - signal type
   - demographics
   - offer amount
4. Send request to users

---

## Consent Flow

1. User receives notification
2. User sees:
   - brand name
   - exact query
   - payment offered
3. User accepts or rejects

---

## Insight Flow

1. Wallet credited instantly
2. Platform takes 10% commission
3. Brand receives:
   - aggregated percentages
   - anonymized trends
4. Raw files never exposed

---

## Kill Switch Flow

1. Access expires automatically after 24 hours
2. Background scheduler revokes permissions
3. Continuous tracking prevented

---

# 📊 Sample CSV Files

## shopping.csv

```csv
date,product,category,price,brand
2024-01-15,Running Shoes,footwear,2800,Nike

# 🔒 Security Architecture

## Encryption

- AES-256 encryption using Fernet
- Encryption performed during upload
- Files decrypted only during computation

---

## Authentication

- JWT token authentication
- Password hashing with bcrypt
- Role-based access control

---

## Privacy

- No raw data sharing
- Only aggregated insights exposed
- Explicit consent required for every request

---

# 📈 Example Brand Insights

Brands receive signals like:

```text
72% of users aged 18-25 buy running products monthly
61% prefer Nike over Adidas
48% run more than 3 times per week
```

NOT:
- names
- emails
- raw CSVs
- personal identities

---

# 🗑️ Data Deletion

Users can:
- permanently delete uploaded files
- revoke brand access instantly
- close account anytime

Designed with:
- DPDP Act (India)
- GDPR-style consent principles

---

# 📄 API Documentation

Once backend is running, visit:

```text
http://localhost:8000/docs
```

Interactive Swagger documentation available for all endpoints.

---

# 🔮 Future Improvements
